This Zinfandel is rich and full-bodied with elegantly balanced components. The nose features aromas of caramel, toasted cedar and vanilla layered over ripe cherries, plums and rose pedals. The palate has a deep, full mouthfeel featuring a velvety core of dark plums and Bing cherries with hints of vanilla and maple, framed by softer peripheral tannins and peppery spices that lead to a very long, complex finish.

The first source is a mature planting of Zinfandel from a west side bench land area featuring red soils over alluvial gravels at the north end of Dry Creek Valley. Bright fruit, peppery spices and a long finish are the characteristics this vineyard contributes to the funished wine.  The second source is from ridge top soils west of Geyserville, overlooking Alexander Valley. The wine from this source features soft, rich flavors with hints of brown spices. The third source is from our old vine source near Talmidge in Mendocino County. This wine has deep, rich flavors, peppery spices and a framework of rustic tannins. The fourth source (1% of this blend) is from a west-facing slope east of Windsor. We also added a touch of Petite Sirah (1% of this blend) from a higher altitude vineyard with volcanic soils for another layer of mid-palate flavor, additional color and tannic structure to frame the soft Zinfandel fruit. These last two components enhance this wine’s texture and structure.
