We had been speaking about his current releases and his anticipation of the 2008 harvest.</p><p>Bob is a California garagiste, literally!&nbsp; His winery is a cinder block storage space near Davis, California.&nbsp; Bob makes wines with minimal intervention, preferring to let gravity and nature perform as many of the winemaking tasks as possible, be it filtration (gravity), fermentation (native yeasts),&nbsp; racking (minimal) and pressing the grapes (as gently as possible).&nbsp; Bob's vinyard sources are the growing regions where his favorite grapes do well, namely Rhone grapes like Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, with a particular fondness for brawny petite sirah and old vines Zinfandel.</p>&lt;!--break--><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marr Cellars produces tiny amounts of hand-crafted wines.&nbsp; Total production is under 2,000 cases.&nbsp; Bob has sourced from some of the best undiscovered vineyards in Northern California, including one in the volcanic foothills of Mount Lassen.&nbsp; His bottlings include two wines named after his children, Cuvee Selena and Cuvee Patrick.&nbsp; The Selena is generally a typical rhone-style blend, dominated by grenache, with some syrah and viognier thrown in for spice.&nbsp; The Patrick is petite sirah based, also blended with rhone varietals and some zinfandel.&nbsp; Single vineyard Old Vines Zin and petite sirah bottling&nbsp; from Sonoma and Mendocino,&nbsp; Syrah from Sonoma, and blends from multiple vineyard sites round out his yearly offerings.&nbsp; And sometimes he is offered a few tons of some impossible to get fruit, such as Hyde Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, which he crafts in his unique style.</p><p>Bob utilizes his food-friendly palate, honed by stints working in restaurants like Ray's Boathouse in Seattle, to create expressive, rich, powerful and balanced wines from these notoriously tricky grapes.&nbsp; Zinfandel can produce staggeringly high sugar levels and become excessively alcoholic, while petite sirah is sometimes so tannic and monolithic that it can scarcely be enjoyed.&nbsp; Bob's wines are emphatically not the case.</p><p>The 2000 Old Vines Zin from the Mattern Ranch in Mendocino County is deep colored, with dark currant fruits on the nose, as well as lighter cherry and cinnamon notes.&nbsp; On the palate the wine has weight without being too heavy, and the fruit and spice balance the substantial alcohol level.</p><p>This wine shows few signs of being eight years old, other than the wood tannins have softened a bit.&nbsp; The color is still dark and deep, nearly opaque.&nbsp; The finish is long, with a touch of sweet jelly fruit giving way to spice and soft tannins.&nbsp; Wow, what a great wine!&nbsp; We enjoyed this with a pasta of mostaccioli, sun dried tomatoes, haricot verts and prosciutto, topped with freshly ground parmegiano reggiano</p><p>I am working with Bob's wines in New York and New Jersey, and will be pre-selling his latest releases to a select group of stores and restaurants in the tri-state area.</p><p>Please contact me if you are interested in carrying Marr Cellars wines in your store, restaurant or distributor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>";s:8:"comments";s:140:"http://www.conviviumbrands.com/content/tasting-8-year-old-zinfandel-marr-cellars-2000-old-vine-zinfandel-mattern-ranch-mendocino-co#comments";s:8:"category";s:39:"Bob MarrMarr CellarsOld Vines Zinfandel";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 13 Aug 2008 12:32:58 +0000";s:10:"dc:creator";s:5:"steve";s:4:"guid";s:37:"288 at http://www.conviviumbrands.com";}i:5;a:8:{s:5:"title";s:42:"Convivium Brands Private Label Wine Tender";s:4:"link";s:81:"http://www.conviviumbrands.com/content/convivium-brands-private-label-wine-tender";s:11:"description";s:1418:"<p>We have had a great response to our last newsletter to suppliers.&nbsp;
